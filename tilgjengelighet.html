                Short presentation of accessibility for your site. Test your site with an automated test. Write a very short text (about 400-500 words) about how you tested the code for accessibility using this automated test. Tell us how you checked, and coding choices you made for universal design beyond what an automated test could tell you. You are recommended to use screenshots from the testing site and of your code â€“ lack of images may affect your score.

            <h1>Accessibility</h1>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                We used <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/">Lighthouse</a> for accessibility testing. Since we were multiple students working in parallel, accessibility testing started before most pages were finished, and was repeated multiple times to ensure the final product retained an acceptable accessibility score. This approach also helped to inform our development practices as we were working on the project.

            <h2>Initial test</h2>
            <img src="bilder/tilgjengelighet/initial-report.png" alt="Overview from Lighthouse report showing scores of 100 for Performance and Best Practices, 75 for Accessibility, 70 for SEO and no score for PWA">

                The initial accessibility test, run quite early in development with only one page being close to finished, revealed just a couple of problems.
                <!-- Mention performance bugs if char limit allows -->
                We were missing <code>alt</code> and <code>width</code>/<code>height</code> attributes for most of our images, which was a simple fix. Lighthouse also advised us about low color legibility in certain areas of the website, though at this point, the design was not finalized yet, so we merely took this as a reminder to consider contrasts when selecting colors further down the line.
                <!-- Mention SEO if char limit allows -->
                <!-- TODO: Image of code -->
            </p>
            

            <h2>Final touches</h2>
            <p>
                Realizing that an automated accessibility test would only get us so far, we decided to ... before submitting the project.
